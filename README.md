## Chrome Built-in AI Progressive Enhancement

This plugin now supports Chrome's experimental built-in AI APIs (see [Chrome AI APIs](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/ai/built-in-apis)) through a unified AI abstraction layer that provides seamless progressive enhancement.

### Features

- **Client-side AI**: If your browser supports `window.AI` (Chrome 138+), you can opt-in to use client-side AI for intent classification and suggestions.
- **Privacy-first**: Client-side AI processing keeps your data in the browser - no data leaves your device.
- **Performance**: Faster response times for simple operations like intent classification.
- **Graceful degradation**: Automatic fallback to server-side AI for complex operations or when client-side AI is unavailable.
- **User control**: Toggle client-side AI preferences in the palette settings.

### How the Progressive Enhancement Works

#### 1. Feature Detection
The plugin automatically detects available AI capabilities:
- Checks for `window.AI.textGeneration` for text processing
- Checks for `window.AI.embedding` for semantic analysis
- Checks for `window.AI.imageGeneration` for image-related tasks
- Identifies browser type and version

#### 2. Request Routing
The unified AI abstraction layer routes requests based on:
- **Client-side AI**: Used for simple operations when available and preferred
  - Intent classification (queries ‚â§ 10 words)
  - Contextual suggestions
  - Simple embeddings (text ‚â§ 1000 characters)
- **Server-side AI**: Used for complex operations or when client-side AI fails
  - Complex text generation
  - Multi-step workflows
  - Advanced natural language processing
- **Rule-based fallback**: Used when all AI services are unavailable
  - Keyword-based intent classification
  - Template-based suggestions
  - Simple hash-based embeddings

#### 3. Fallback Strategy
The system implements a three-tier fallback strategy:
1. **Primary**: Client-side AI (if available and preferred)
2. **Secondary**: Server-side AI (OpenAI/Claude)
3. **Tertiary**: Rule-based matching

#### 4. User Experience
- **Settings modal**: Shows AI status, available features, and browser compatibility
- **Real-time feedback**: Users see which AI source is being used
- **Transparent operation**: No interruption when switching between AI sources
- **Performance indicators**: Loading states indicate AI processing

### Technical Implementation

#### AI Abstraction Layer
The `AIAbstraction` class provides a unified interface:
```typescript
const aiAbstraction = AIAbstraction.getInstance();
const response = await aiAbstraction.process({
  type: 'intent_classification',
  query: 'create a new blog post'
});
```

#### Request Types
- `intent_classification`: Categorizes user queries
- `suggestions`: Generates contextual command suggestions
- `embedding`: Creates semantic embeddings for similarity matching
- `text_generation`: Generates complex text responses

#### Response Format
```typescript
{
  success: boolean,
  data: any,
  error?: string,
  source: 'client' | 'server' | 'fallback'
}
```

### Browser Compatibility

| Browser | Version | Client-side AI | Features |
|---------|---------|----------------|----------|
| Chrome | 138+ | ‚úÖ Full support | textGeneration, embedding, imageGeneration |
| Chrome | <138 | ‚ùå Not available | Server-side AI only |
| Firefox | Any | ‚ùå Not available | Server-side AI only |
| Safari | Any | ‚ùå Not available | Server-side AI only |
| Edge | Any | ‚ùå Not available | Server-side AI only |

### Privacy and Security

- **Client-side processing**: Data never leaves your browser when using client-side AI
- **No tracking**: Chrome's built-in AI doesn't track or store your queries
- **User control**: You can disable client-side AI at any time
- **Fallback security**: Server-side AI uses your configured API keys and follows your privacy settings

### Performance Benefits

- **Reduced latency**: Client-side AI eliminates network round-trips
- **Lower costs**: Reduces API calls to external AI services
- **Better availability**: Works even when external AI services are down
- **Scalability**: Reduces server load for simple operations
