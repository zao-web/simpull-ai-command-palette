# AI Command Palette - TODO List

## Chrome Built-in AI Integration ✅ COMPLETE

- [x] **Add feature detection for Chrome built-in AI APIs (window.AI) in the command palette frontend**
  - Enhanced `ClientSideAI.ts` with comprehensive feature detection
  - Added `getAvailableFeatures()` method to detect textGeneration, embedding, and imageGeneration
  - Added `getBrowserInfo()` method for browser compatibility checking
  - Improved error handling and logging

- [x] **Implement a unified AI abstraction layer in TypeScript to route AI calls to client-side AI if available, otherwise to server-side AI**
  - Created `AIAbstraction.ts` with singleton pattern
  - Implemented three-tier fallback strategy: client-side → server-side → rule-based
  - Added request routing based on operation complexity
  - Integrated with user preferences for client-side AI usage

- [x] **Use client-side AI for simple intent classification and contextual suggestions in the command palette, with fallback to server-side AI**
  - Updated `CommandPalette.tsx` to use unified AI abstraction layer
  - Enhanced `handleSearch` function with intelligent AI routing
  - Added contextual suggestions loading using AI abstraction
  - Implemented real-time AI source feedback

- [x] **Add user setting to opt-in/out of client-side AI usage for privacy**
  - Enhanced settings modal with detailed AI status display
  - Added browser compatibility information
  - Implemented user preference persistence
  - Added disabled state for unsupported browsers

- [x] **Document the progressive enhancement and fallback strategy for AI in the codebase**
  - Comprehensive documentation in README.md
  - Technical implementation details
  - Browser compatibility table
  - Privacy and security information
  - Performance benefits explanation

## Server-side AI Processing ✅ COMPLETE

- [x] **Create AI_Processor.php for handling unified AI requests**
  - Implemented request processing for all AI operation types
  - Added fallback methods for when AI services are unavailable
  - Integrated with existing AI_Service and Context_Engine
  - Added REST API endpoint `/ai-command-palette/v1/ai-process`

## Technical Implementation Details

### Files Created/Modified:
1. **`assets/js/src/utils/ClientSideAI.ts`** - Enhanced with comprehensive feature detection
2. **`assets/js/src/utils/AIAbstraction.ts`** - New unified AI abstraction layer
3. **`assets/js/src/components/CommandPalette.tsx`** - Updated to use AI abstraction
4. **`src/Core/AI_Processor.php`** - New server-side AI processor
5. **`ai-command-palette.php`** - Added AI processor REST endpoint
6. **`README.md`** - Comprehensive documentation

### Key Features Implemented:
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Seamless fallback from client-side to server-side to rule-based AI
- **Privacy-First**: Client-side AI keeps data in browser
- **Performance Optimization**: Reduces API calls and latency
- **User Control**: Granular settings for AI preferences
- **Browser Compatibility**: Automatic detection and graceful degradation
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling and logging

### API Endpoints:
- `POST /wp-json/ai-command-palette/v1/ai-process` - Unified AI processing endpoint

### Browser Support:
- **Chrome 138+**: Full client-side AI support
- **Other browsers**: Server-side AI with rule-based fallback

All Chrome built-in AI integration features are now complete and ready for production use.
